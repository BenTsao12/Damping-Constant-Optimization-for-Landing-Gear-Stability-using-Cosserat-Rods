# Damping-Constant-Optimization-for-Landing-Gear-Stability-using-Cosserat-Rods

Project Description:
1. Analyzed landing gear with the Cosserat rod theorem and optimized damping for faster stabilization.

2. Implemented Genetic Algorithms (GA) to systematically optimize the damping ratio to reduce the stable time.

3. The optimized damping ratio reduced the stable time from 60 seconds to 30 seconds
